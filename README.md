Two trends from the data clearly jump out from the last two calculations.

In the "Scores by School Size" section, small and medium schools (under 1500 students) have an overall passing rate of over 20 points more than the large schools (over 1500 students). The math passing rate is almost 30 points less in the big schools. This suggests that the smaller schools do significantly better on testing.

In the "Scores by School Type" section, charter schools do significantly better than district schools. Here, the overall passing rate is over 20 points better for the charter schools. 

These two trends correlate somewhat, since the charter schools tend to be smaller than the district schools.
